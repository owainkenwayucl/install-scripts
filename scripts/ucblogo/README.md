Patches for UCBLogo
===================

UCBLogo is an old (but good package) and so as time goes by it gets harder and harder to build on modern systems.  This directory contains patches to help.

The main site is available here: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/logo.html

All original code remains copyright of the various original developers, most principly Brian Harvey at UCB and as it is GPL v2, so are these patches.
