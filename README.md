# Personal Install Scripts

This repository contains install scripts I use to build my personal installs of packages in my home directory on UCL's clusters.  It depends on the main buildscripts repo being deployed in `/shared/ucl/...`.

These scripts almost certainly do not work elsewhere but do contain hints that might help you install things on your platforms.

I also use this to test things, for example to do tests of the Nvidia compilers ahead of deploying them centrally.
